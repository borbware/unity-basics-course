* releasing first commercial game EMUUROM this year
## About this course

* Everyone will create multiple video games with Unity
* Course is separated into three four-week stages
* [Stages](Stages.md)
* [Stage 1](Stage1.md)
    * Learn the basics of Unity & game programming
    * With the acquired skills, make tiny games on your own
* Stage 2
	* Dive deeper in Unity
	* Learn about game design & game industry
	* Create a bit larger (yet still tiny) games in teams
* Stage 3
    * Create a single game project
## About YOU

* Your gamedev/programming/art/music background
* Which video game you like pops to your mind first?
* What kind of a video game would you like to work on?
* What was your first video game experience?
* What is the last video game you played?
* Most disappointing game
* The worst game you've played

## Teams

* Team X
* Team Y
* Team Z

## Applications

* Download [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
* Install latest Unity LTS (long term support) version 2020.3.27f1
* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), aka VS code
  * during install: add to context menu
* Install [Discord](https://discord.com/)

	* Discord (for communication)
	* Unity
	* Google (for collaborating with Google Drive & Docs)
	* later this week: Github (for version control)
	* even later: Itch.io (for publishing your games)


## Unity

[Unity basics 0. What is Unity?](unity-basics/0-what-is-unity.md)


## Unity Documentation

* [Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityManual.html)
* [Script Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference)
* if you don't know how something works, this should be the first place to learn from
* Docs will be heavily featured during the course!
## The Unity Interface

[Unity basics 1. The Unity Interface](unity-basics/1-the-unity-interface.md)


## Week projects

* During Stage 1, a new week project is introduced every week
* The deadlines for the projects are on Fridays, and we will continuously work on it during the weekdays
* On Fridays, the projects are showcased
* Every project has three separate stages
  * ⭐ The MVP (minimum viable product)
  * ⭐⭐ Some extra feature included
  * ⭐⭐⭐ Includes an advanced feature (which isn't necessarily introduced during the classes), or a feature of your own design 
  * you can choose which stage you aim to complete 

## Week project 1: Clock

<!-- _backgroundColor: LightSkyBlue -->
For the first week project, you will create a 3d model of a clock with ticking hour, minute and second indicators.

The project is separated into individual exercises. For more help, you can follow the [CatlikeCoding clock tutorial](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/game-objects-and-scripts/).


## WP Exercise 1. Creating a project
<!-- _backgroundColor: LightSkyBlue -->
* Install and setup all the tools needed and create your first 3D project for the course with the name `Week1Clock`.
* This project will be worked on step by step in the coming exercises.

## WP Exercise 2. Building a simple clock
<!-- _backgroundColor: LightSkyBlue -->
Create a 3D model of a clock from Unity's primitives with three hands and 12 hour indicators.

Unlike in the picture below, set all the indicators to 12. They will be later rotated to correct positions with C# scripting.

# Day 2: Scripting 1

## Day 2 Schedule

* Morning
  * [Programming 1: Variables and conditionals](programming/1-variables-and-conditionals.md)
* Afternoon
  * Working on the week project
## WP exercise 3. Animating the clock
<!-- _backgroundColor: LightSkyBlue -->
Make the clock hands move when time goes on.

⭐ Make the movement instantaneous: the second indicator moves once per second directly to the next position
⭐⭐ Make the movement smooth: the second indicator moves continuously at a rate of one full rotation per minute
⭐⭐⭐ Make the movement realistic: study how the hands of a real clock moves! The second indicator moves incrementally between fixed positions, but the movement is not instantaneous. Try to replicate this. 

# Day 3: Assets & scripting
