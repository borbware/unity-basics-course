## Basics

## VS code shortcuts

* ***CTRL+SHIFT+UP/DOWN*** move code line
* ***CTRL+SHIFT+D*** duplicate line
* ***CTRL+Ã–*** for showing/hiding terminal
* ***CTRL+.*** for auto-"using" / auto-creating missing functions
* ***CTRL+TAB*** / ***CTRL+SHIFT+TAB*** 
  * *View: Open Next/Previous Recently Used Editor*
  * By default, these shortcuts open the recently used tab, and it can be confusing
  * You can change the behaviour in *Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts*
  * Set behaviour to *View: Open Next Editor* / *View: Open Previous Editor*
