# Playcentric Design Process

- set player experience goals
  - "how should the player feel?"
  - example: freedom to pursue goals of the game in any order
  - does NOT specify how features are implemented
- try to see the game from the lens of player experience
  - what is the player thinking?
  - what choices are offered? what choices are made? 
- playtesting very early
- fast prototyping
  - either by coding or, if possible, with pen and paper
  - iterate based on player response
