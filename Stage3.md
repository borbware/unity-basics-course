* 3-day pitching
  * Start with two to three people teams that first come up with project ideas
  * presentation of ideas to everyone 
  * Anonymous vote: Which OTHER pair's idea would you like to work with?
    * The most, the second most
  * Groups are assigned
* Week 1: Pre-production
  * design doc and a prototype
* Week 2: Concept iteration

* Every week:
  * Take responsibility for communication and tasks 
  * Commence playtesting in the class

## Evaluation

* CLARITY: Are the instructions and board concise and easy to understand?

* INNOVATION: What is new and exciting in the gameplay to stimulate interest in new challenges?

* IMMERSION: Is the story compelling (setting, action framing, art and music)?

* FLOW:  Does the player feel constantly productive, able to act and have those actions matter (advance their agenda) every turn?

* FIERO: Multiple big victory moments for players?
