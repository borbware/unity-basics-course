# Stage 3

## Pitching your game

* If you want to get a publisher, you need to ***pitch*** your game idea to someone
  * For that, you need to create a ***pitch deck***
  * Essentially, explain your game idea in detail
* [Raw Fury Pitch Deck example](https://www.slideshare.net/JohanToresson/raw-fury-pitch-deck-template)
* [More Pitch deck examples](https://www.notion.so/Pitch-Decks-f56e38c13fe6417f8379859e74367e1a)

## 2.5-day pitching

### Day 1
* Start with teams of 2-3 people
* Come up with a project idea
* Start creating a pitch deck with Google Slides
### Day 2
* Finish your pitch
* Teams present ideas to everyone 
* Anonymous vote: 
  * Would you like to work on this game?
    * 1: Yes please
    * 2: No preference
    * 3: Not really
* After the presentation, I evaluate the pitches 
* I create teams based on vote
* Next week:
  * The winning pitches are revealed
  * Teams are formed

### Pitch evaluation: Project scope

* How *doable* is the game?
* How much assets are needed?
* How much content is needed?
  * Levels, quests, story...
* How many difficult technical challenges are needed to overcome?
* How well the game fits to be made with Unity?

### Pitch evaluation: Game idea

* ***Clarity***: Is the game concise and easy to understand?
* ***Innovation***: What is new and exciting in the gameplay to stimulate interest?
* ***Immersion***: Is the story compelling (setting, action framing, art and music)?
* ***Flow***: Does the player feel constantly productive & able to act? Do actions matter?
* ***Fiero***: Multiple big moments of victory for players?

## Sprints
### Every sprint:
* Take responsibility for communication and tasks 
* Commence playtesting in the class

### Sprint 1: Pre-production
* Create a design doc
* Create a repository and assign tasks 
* Create a prototype
* Set player experience goals
* Playtest with other groups, if possible
### Sprint 2: Concept iteration
