# Stage 3

## Pitching your game

* If you want to get a publisher, you need to ***pitch*** your game idea to someone
  * For that, you need to create a ***pitch deck***
  * Essentially, explain your game idea in detail
* [Raw Fury Pitch Deck example](https://www.slideshare.net/JohanToresson/raw-fury-pitch-deck-template)
* [More Pitch deck examples](https://www.notion.so/Pitch-Decks-f56e38c13fe6417f8379859e74367e1a)

## Rules of thumb

* Be concise
* Be enthusiastic
* Be honest
* Sell your hook (unique selling point)
* Know your scope

## Example pitch structure

* Explain your game in one or two sentences (What's the hook?)
* Give details on key features
  * Core mechanics
  * Design pillars
  * Art style
* Explain gameplay
  * What do you DO in the game?
* Explain technical challenges
---
* Explain your development status
  * Where you're at
  * What you need
* Budget
* Compare to your competition
* Sales analysis
* "About us"
  * Who are in the team
  * What are your strengths?
* Contact (Call to action)

<!--
1. I don't give a crap about your backstory
2. I don't give a crap about your inventory system
3. I'm not going to design your game to you.
4. Pillars are not hooks
5. You never explained to me what the player does
6. DOn't use realism to excuse bad design "In the real world, no one can double jump"
7. "It's a game show!"
8. "It's a parody!"
9. You never mentioned your glaringly obvious tech risk
10. Your proof of concept doesn't prove your concept (too simple prototype)
11. Having lots of shitty art doesn't make it less shitty
12. I can't tell what's placeholder and what's not
13. You polished too early.
14. Your sample dialog sucks
15. You're pandering to the latest tech craze
16. "Game X" already exists (you try to make something that already exists)
17. "Can you help us negotiate a license deal with Marvel"?
18. I know more about your monetization than your mechanics.
19. You have no idea how much resources you need to build this thing.
20. Your business plan is based on outliers. "We're going to sell as much as WoW!"
21. You seem like you're like a huge pain in the ass to work with.
22. You're annoyed that I'm asking questions.
23. You trash other games. Or other companies. Or other developers.

## 2.5-day pitching

### Day 1
* Start with teams of 2-3 people
* Come up with a project idea
* Start creating a pitch deck with Google Slides
### Day 2
* Finish your pitch
* Teams present ideas to everyone 
* Anonymous vote: 
  * Would you like to work on this game?
    * 1: Yes please
    * 2: No preference
    * 3: Not really
* After the presentation, I evaluate the pitches 
* I create teams based on vote
* Next week:
  * The winning pitches are revealed
  * Teams are formed

### Pitch evaluation: Project scope

* How *doable* is the game?
* How much assets are needed?
* How much content is needed?
  * Levels, quests, story...
* How many difficult technical challenges are needed to overcome?
* How well the game fits to be made with Unity?

### Pitch evaluation: Game idea

* ***Clarity***: Is the game concise and easy to understand?
* ***Innovation***: What is new and exciting in the gameplay to stimulate interest?
* ***Immersion***: Is the story compelling (setting, action framing, art and music)?
* ***Flow***: Does the player feel constantly productive & able to act? Do actions matter?
* ***Fiero***: Multiple big moments of victory for players?

## Sprints
### Every sprint:
* Take responsibility for communication and tasks 
* Commence playtesting in the class

### Sprint 1: Pre-production
* Create a design doc
* Create a repository and assign tasks 
* Create a prototype
* Set player experience goals
* Playtest with other groups, if possible
### Sprint 2: Concept iteration
