# Publishing your game

## Building an executable

1) Create a build in Unity into the ***Builds*** folder and check that it runs (See [Building](../unity-cookbook/building.md)).
2) Zip the contents of the Builds folder into a zip archive. (Right click > Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder)

## Uploading to itch.io

* Create an account to itch.io and log in
* Go to your page (youraccount.itch.io)
* Click arrow on the top-right corner and choose ***Upload new project***
* In the ***Create a new project*** page, write at least
  * The title for your game
  * A short description
  * Click ***Upload files*** to upload your zip 
  * Add a longer description in Details (maybe explain the controls of the game there?)
  * Click ***Save & view page***

## Setting your project public

* Now your game has a page, but it isn't published yet
* Go to your game page (youraccount.itch.io/your-new-game)
* Click ***Edit game*** to go back to game settings
* Scroll down and Set visibility to ***Public*** (then others can see your game!)
