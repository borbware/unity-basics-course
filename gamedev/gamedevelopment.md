## About game development

* Game development is hard.
* multidisciplinary work
* even small games are complex systems

## About game engines

* sometimes Unity isn't the best option!
* there are roughly three types of game development depending on your technology
  * these aren't undisputable facts, I made these following descriptions up
  * think for yourself if there's something missing

### Type 1: All-purpose Engine
  * Unity, Unreal, Godot, GameMaker Studio
  * 3D or 2D
  * drag-and-drop GUI
  * not necessarily "real" programming involved
  * when is, you won't be programming the main loop, only gluing your scripts on top of existing structures
  * suited for games big and small
  * jack of all trades, master of none
### Type 2: Framework
  * Love2D, Monogame, Pygame
  * 2D easy, 3D harder
  * no engine "window", almost everything happens in a text editor
  * basically an API full of helper functions
    * "draw sprite on coordinates x,y"
  * suited for people who...
    * want to have a tighter control on what's happening under the hood
    * want to build their own structures
    * think all-purpose engines get on their way 
### Type 3: Specialized Engine
  * Renpy, RPGMaker, Adventure Game Studio, Twine
  * A tool for making a specific kind of game
  * can involve code or its own scripting/description language
  * very fast for what it does
  * easier to fully grasp due to limited output
