## About game development

* Game development is hard
* Multidisciplinary work
* even small games are complex systems

## Good principles

* Greyboxing
  * When testing digital or tabletop games to decide if core mechanics are fun, avoid including much art: use simple forms so the audience can focus on the mechanic: “Greyboxing”
  * Good Mechanics = fun game.
  * Art+Audio can create greater immersion, a more memorable experience, but cannot fix a mechanic (or game) that is not fun.

* Fail faster
  * Do not spend a ton of time thinking or arguing about whether to include a mechanic: try it! See if it works,  
  * You don’t need to try EVERYTHING, but if you have collaborators/stakeholders excited about an idea, don’t dispute the idea– try it out and see if it works.
  * Burn through a lot of bad or mediocre ideas as fast as possible to get to the good ones. 

## Have a good team

* What is common in good teams?
  * 5. impact: work matters
  * 4. meaning: personally important
  * 3. clear roles & clear goals
  * 2. dependability: things get done on time
  * 1. psychological safety

## Random

* When making changes to variables, make them big
  * No: 1->2, 4.5->4.7
  * More like: 1 -> 10
  * At least double/halve the value when adjusting in the beginning
  * Finetuning happens later
