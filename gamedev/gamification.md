# Gamification

## What is gamification?

Game-like elements have silently found their way to many web services.

* Gamifying aims for increased and continuous user interaction
* Achieved by adding a "game layer" on top of a service
* Can make the user experience more engaging
* Can enhance activities where a continuous engagement is beneficial for the user, for example learning a language

* [Errant Signal: Gamification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWfMjQKXZXk)

## Gamification is bullshit

* Criticism
  * At worst, the gamified elements are thin and tacked-on
  * Can be seen as an artificial means to boost engagement, or even as exploitation
  * Is usually created to benefit corporate interests, rather than users
  * Provide simulated satisfaction instead of concrete rewards

## Gamification elements

* EXP bars & leveling
  * Do stuff and you get rewarded with number going up
* Badges & Achievements
* Leaderboards
* Performance graphs
* Narrative
* Teammates

---

* Streaks
  * Do stuff every day so number doesn't go back to 0
* Tutorials
  * Using a service starts with a tutorial where different UI elements and their functions are highlighted
* Juice
  * The preferred interaction feels good to do: it's juiced with animations and/or sound effects

---

* Limited features
  * When you start using a service, you only get access to a limited set of features
  * Access is granted only after doing X
  * This makes starting up more straightforward. The user has less options to get confused by when only the essentials are exposed at first.
* Easter eggs
  * Do an obscure interaction and you find a secret!

## Examples

* Duolingo
  * don't break your streak!
* Google maps
  * gain levels by contributing images & descriptions
* Linkedin
  * start-up: add info about yourself to advance a progress bar of your "Profile strength"
---
* Github
  * the green contribution chart
  * get achievements based on events you've attended
* Kahoot
  * Time-based scoring
  * Leaderboards for top three
* Twitter
  * Likes & retweets
  * Juiced like button
  * Number of likes & retweets is shown, and you get notified for likes & retweets
  * If you have more followers, you see less ads
