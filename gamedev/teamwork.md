# Teamwork

## First things first: Have a good team

* What is common in good teams?

  * 5: ***Impact***: work matters
  * 4: ***Meaning***: personally important
  * 3: ***Clear roles & goals***: you know what you're doing
  * 2: ***Dependability***: things get done on time
  * 1: ***Psychological safety***: you won't be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes

## ...or a great team!

* What is common with *great* teams?
* ***Follow a shared vision and purpose***: Everyone on the team understands the goal of what they are working on.
* ***Complement other team members' skills***: Team members depend on each other to achieve their goals by applying their unique skills to a shared goal.
* ***Exhibit open and safe communication***: Team members feel safe to communicate anything to one another.
---
* ***Share decision making, responsibility, and accountability***: The team succeeds or fails together, not as individuals. Everyone earns their spot on the team daily. There is no room for titles or egos.
* ***Have fun together***: They spend time together and enjoy each other's company. They care for one another.
* ***Deliver value***: Great teams take pride in their work and deliver high value consistently.
* ***Demonstrate shared commitment***: Great teams have a unified cause. 

* How can we cultivate this kind of teamwork?
