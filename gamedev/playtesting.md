# Playtesting

## Playtesting as part of design

* Designing through playtesting is a way to put ***player experience*** first
* Have an idea for a game? Don’t spend a lot of time obsessing about the design until you have tried it with players!
* Ideas alone don't reflect how engaging a game is to play

## Playtesting cornerstones

* ***PREPARE A PROTOTYPE***: Keep it simple (greyboxing) to quickly test ideas (failing faster)

* ***OBSERVE OTHERS PLAYING YOUR GAME***. Avoid influencing their experience, where possible. 

* ***LISTEN***: Ask them to speak while playing and write down everything they say (and you see them do) which offers a new perspective on any aspect of gameplay or user interface. 

* ***INTEGRATE***: Iterate your game mechanics and interface with this feedback in mind, while also listening to your own instincts. In other words,  listen but do not treat all feedback as infallible. 


## Playtesting in practice

1) ***Communicate the plan*** and set expectations:
     * "Thank you for being here"
     * "The game is still a work-in-progress so expect that it sucks"
     * Ask tester(s) to talk out loud their thoughts while playing
     * Remind that you will be quiet and take notes
2) ***Being quiet*** is the most important rule, and the most easiest to break when things go wrong
     * Remember, you won't be sitting next to people who you've sold your game to
     * When the player does something "wrong", or doesn't get something, or is stuck, it is interesting to see where it leads

3) During playtesting, ***take lots of notes***:
      * where they get stuck or confused
      * what they enjoy
      * what was unexpected
4) Post-Playtest Debriefing: When game is done (or tried for ~15 minutes), discuss ***highlights and problems***.
   * List 1-3 big change suggestions to explore.
   * Thank your testers!

## Note about playtest feedback

* The feedback you get from playtesting is the most valuable data about the player perception of your game you have during development
* A note, however:
  * To my experience, playtesters are good at pointing out what's bad about the game
  * ...but their ***solution suggestions*** miss the mark more often than not

## Why playtest?

* Creation is 1% inspiration and 99% revision.
* Our reality is not the only reality.
<!-- Culture: common modes of consumption, presentation, or interaction. -->
* Testing is how we come to understand our audience’s needs.
* Also, remember: negative player feedback is very rarely a critique of the designer
  * Rather, it is born out of wanting to see the game become its best possible version
## Product first vs audience first

* ***PRODUCT FIRST:*** We have a game we want to make, and must identify the audience that will enjoy that game.
 
* ***AUDIENCE FIRST:*** We have an audience we want to reach and so we design a game to fulfill their interests.

## Focus testing

* Based on feedback, implement changes to your game
* Playtest your game with a ***focus group*** who get the new changes
* Send a survey to the focus group and implement changes based on that to the general audience

## Radical revision

* Sometimes you get stuck in the development process, and need to shake things up in a major way
* ***Radical revision*** explores complete overhauls of your ideas
  * Dangerously sweep away all of the sweat and blood you have shed so far and imagine ***impossible*** new directions.
 
* You don’t have to follow those paths!
  * You just need to give yourself ***the chance*** to consider something novel

* What if you kept the way your characters move, but changed the victory and lose conditions
* Or what if you added new GameObjects that could be used to help balance randomness, or mess with other players?
