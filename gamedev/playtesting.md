# Playtesting

## Playtesting as part of design

Designing through playtesting is a way to put player experience first. Have an idea for a game? Don’t spend a lot of time obsessing about the design until you have tried it with players!

PREPARE A PROTOTYPE: Keep it simple (greyboxing) to quickly test ideas (failing faster)

OBSERVE OTHERS PLAYING YOUR GAME. Avoid influencing their experience, where possible. 

LISTEN: Ask them to speak while playing and write down everything they say (and you see them do) which offers a new perspective on any aspect of gameplay or user interface. 

INTEGRATE: Iterate your game mechanics and interface with this feedback in mind, while also listening to your own instincts. In other words,  listen but do not treat all feedback as infallible. 


## How does one playtest?

* Communicate the plan and set expectations:
  * Thank you for being here
  * The game is still a work-in-progress so expect that it sucks
  * Ask tester(s) to talk out loud their thoughts while playing
  * Remind that you will be quiet and take notes
* Being quiet is the most important rule, and the most easiest to break when things go wrong
  * Remember, you won't be sitting next to people who you've sold your game to
  * When the player does something "wrong", or doesn't get something, or is stuck, it is interesting to see where it leads
* During playtesting, take lots of notes: where they get stuck or confused, and what they enjoy. Only speak when they get too completely stuck to proceed!
* Post-Playtest Debriefing: When game is done (or tried for 15 minutes), discuss highlights and problems. List 3 big change suggestions to explore. Thank your testers!
 

## Why playtest?

* Creation is 1% inspiration and 99% revision.
* Our reality is not the only reality.
* Culture: common modes of consumption, presentation, or interaction.
* Testing is how we come to understand our Audience’s needs.

## Product first vs audience first

PRODUCT FIRST: We have a game we want to make, and must identify the audience that will enjoy that game.
 
AUDIENCE FIRST: We have an audience we want to reach and so we design a game to fulfill their interests.

## Focus testing

* Based on feedback, implement changes to your game
* Playtest your game with a ***focus group*** who get the new changes

## Radical revision

* Revision that explores complete overhauls of your ideas: Dangerously sweep away all of the sweat and blood you have shed so far and imagine impossible new directions.
 
* You don’t have to follow those paths—you just need to give yourself the chance to consider them, to permit those ideas to percolate and enrich your games.

* What if you kept the way your characters move, but change the victory and lose conditions? Or what if you added assets that could be used to help balance poor dice rolls, or mess with other players?
