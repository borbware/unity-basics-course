# Playtesting

## Playtesting as part of design

* Have an idea for a game?
  * Don't spend time obsessing about its design until someone has tried to play it!
* Ideas alone don't reflect how engaging a game is to play
  * Thus, it's always a good idea to prepare a prototype for playtesting ASAP
* By integrating playtesting to your design process, you emphasize the ***player experience***
 
## Playtesting uses people as a resource

* Be cautious before giving your game for the general public to test
  * You don't want to get the same bug report 7983 times!
* It's better to first give your game for one person at a time to test 
  * The game doesn't need to look and feel like a finished product
  * But this process aims to remove biggest bugs before a wider release
  * This way, you get better feedback from the bigger release
* Also, it's notable to understand that after a playtest session, you have used up one person
  * When they play the game again, their view of the game is now clouded by the earlier playtest
  * To get more objective playtest results, you need a constant flux of new testers!

## Playtesting in practice


### Before playtesting
<!-- _backgroundColor: #29366f -->

* ***Have a plan.***
  * What do you want to get out of playtesting?
* It's a good idea to have some questions in mind you want answers to. Examples:
  * Does X work?
  * Do the players figure Y out?
  * Does the game teach its mechanics to the players?
* Especially early in development, it's important to focus on the ***first seconds of the game***.
  * Does the game grasp the players' attention?
  * Do the players do what you expected them to do?
* Also...
  * ***Make sure your build works.***

### During playtesting

<!-- _backgroundColor: #29366f -->
* ***Communicate the plan*** and set expectations:
     * "Thank you for being here"
     * "The game is still a work-in-progress so expect that it sucks"
       * "Do not blame yourself for mistakes."
       * "Remember, you are not being tested, it's YOU who are testing the game!"
     * Ask tester(s) to talk out loud their thoughts while playing
       * "Narrate what is happening on screen!"
     * Remind that you will be quiet and take notes

* ***Be quiet***! It's the most important rule.
  * ...and the easiest to break when things go wrong
     * Remember, you won't be sitting next to people who you've sold your game to
     * When the player does something "wrong", or doesn't get something, or is stuck, it is interesting to see where it leads
   * You can remind the player, however, to not blame themselves if they seem to do that.

<!-- _backgroundColor: #29366f -->

* ***Take lots of notes*** during playtesting:
  * where they get stuck or confused
  * what they enjoy
  * what was unexpected
  * any ***new perspectives*** on gameplay, user interface, etc
  * Maybe even record gameplay for later analysis
* ***Post-Playtest Debriefing***
  * When game is done (or tried for ~15 minutes), discuss highlights and problems
   * List 1-3 big change suggestions to explore.
   * Thank your testers!

## Note about playtest feedback

* The feedback you get from playtesting is the most valuable data about the player perception of your game you have during development
* A note, however:
  * To my experience, playtesters are good at pointing out what's bad about the game
  * ...but their ***solution suggestions*** miss the mark more often than not
* Iterate your game mechanics and interface with the feedback in mind... while also listening to your own instincts!
  * You can't implement every suggestion!
  * Instinct for what the game needs and what it doesn't is one of the most important skills for the game designer to develop

## Why playtest?

* Creation is 1% inspiration and 99% revision. (Jason Wiser)
* Our reality is not the only reality. (Also Jason Wiser)
<!-- Culture: common modes of consumption, presentation, or interaction. -->
* Testing is how we come to understand our audience's needs. (Yup it's Jason Wiser)
* Also, remember: negative player feedback is very rarely a critique of the designer
  * Rather, it is born out of wanting to see the game become its best possible version

# Additional fleeting ideas

## Two schools of game dev
<!-- _backgroundColor: #5d275d -->

* ***PRODUCT FIRST:*** We have a game we want to make, and must identify the audience that will enjoy that game.
 
* ***AUDIENCE FIRST:*** We have an audience we want to reach and so we design a game to fulfill their interests.

## Focus testing
<!-- _backgroundColor: #5d275d -->

* Based on feedback, implement changes to your game
* Playtest your game with a ***focus group*** who get the new changes
* Send a survey to the focus group and implement changes based on that to the general audience

## Radical revision
<!-- _backgroundColor: #5d275d -->

* Sometimes you get stuck in the development process, and need to shake things up in a major way
* ***Radical revision*** explores complete overhauls of your ideas
  * Dangerously sweep away all of the sweat and blood you have shed so far and imagine ***impossible*** new directions.
* You don't have to follow those paths!
  * You just need to give yourself ***the chance*** to consider something novel
* What if you kept the way your characters move, but changed the victory and lose conditions
* Or what if you added new GameObjects that could be used to help balance randomness, or mess with other players?
