# Accessibility

## What is accessibility

* Some players have conditions that can make your game more difficult to play, including:
  * colorblindness
  * vision impairment
  * hearing disabilities
  * motor disabilities
* To ensure your game can be played by the widest audience possible, consider ***accessibility*** (suom. esteett√∂myys, saavutettavuus)

## Rules of thumb

* In many cases, ***good design is accessible design***
* When conveying critical information, do not rely on a single sense 
  * Instead of using just color to signify something, use color & shape!
  * Use sound to convey information as well
    * some fighting games do it well enough that they can be played blind competitively
  * Also, have subtitles for spoken dialogue
* Controls
  * Remappable controls
  * Alternatives to rapid tapping (it's not that fun anyway...)
