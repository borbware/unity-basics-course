# Game design

## Games

* "Voluntary engagement with unnecessary obstacles"
  * Jane McGonigal, *Reality is Broken*

* Sports
* Yard Games
* Card games
* Board Games
* Pinball tables
* Video Games

## Verbs

* Primary player actions
  * "Jump"
  * "Attack"
  * "Build"
* What verbs do these games have?
  * Laivan upotus
  * Kirkonrotta
  * Super Mario Bros.

## Game mechanics

* What is a game mechanic?
* Example of a game mechanic?
  * [List of Board game mechanics](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgamemechanic)

## Game designer

* The job of a game designer is that of a gardener
  * nourish good ideas
  * nip unnecessary and harmful weeds in the bud
  * grow a functional system enclosed in a limited space


## Game design through iteration

## Reasons to engage with media

* Mastery: grown skills in doing/accomplishing a task
* Autonomy: Ability and freedom to make meaningful choices
* Sensation: Physical sensations or the new
* Connection: Feeling connected to others/community

## Types of players 

xx 

## Playcentric Design Process

* Set player experience goals
  * "how should the player feel?"
  * example: freedom to pursue goals of the game in any order
  * does NOT specify how features are implemented
* try to see the game from the lens of player experience
  * what is the player thinking?
  * what choices are offered? what choices are made? 
* playtesting very early
* fast prototyping
  * either by coding or, if possible, with pen and paper
  * iterate based on player response

## Design for the players

* In the development process, designers becomes blind to their own games
* Due to familiarity:
  * designers can make the game too hard (in a wrong way)
  * designers don't explain things that are obvious to *them*
* ***The only truth about your game is inside the mind of the player***
* If player feedback contradicts with your preconception, something has gone wrong
* Player feedback is very rarely a critique of the designer
  * Rather, it is born out of wanting to see the game become its best possible version

## Design to make the game its best possible version

* The initial idea for your game might turn out to be boring to play
* Usually, there is *something* good, though
* **Follow the fun**
  * If some random interaction happens to create interesting situations, build upon it
* Are there some design elements that seem to "create themselves"?
  * **Follow them**
  * If you were to create a puzzle game, but the game *wants* to be an action game, then so be it

### Design to guide players

* "Players tend to optimize the fun out of game"
	* -> nudge towards fun interactions
* Interesting outcomes from player mistakes
* Designing for different types of players
  * [Bartle's taxonomy of player types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types)
    * Killers, Achievers, Socializers, Explorers

## Kishōtenketsu
* Four-act structure
* Works for levels, worlds, whole games
  * Ki: Introduce
  * Shō: Develop
  * Ten: Twist
  * Ketsu: Conclude
### Intensity graph
  * Ebb and flow

## Some basic principles

* Start small. No, smaller than that.

* versatile verbs
  * Maniac Mansion
* dual purpose design
  * more with less
* meaningful choices

## Random ideas for mechanics
* Two types of random
* Synergic systems
* Gotcha puzzles
  * Obvious solution fails!
* Show the lock before the key
* small integers
* Game feel in isolation
* Invisible tutorial
* Realistic vs gameistic

## Good design??

* usually subjective
* some subjective rules of thumb...
  * good design solves many problems at once
    * ...and doesn't introduce new ones
  * good design explains itself
    * use real-world analogues: "water puts out fire"
  * good design fuels creativity
    * complex outcomes out of simple rules 
  * good design begets more good design
