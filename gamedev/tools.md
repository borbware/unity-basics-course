## Game engines

* sometimes Unity isn't the best option!
* there are roughly three types of game development depending on your technology
  * these aren't undisputable facts, I made up all these types lol

### Type 1: All-purpose Engine

  * Unity, Unreal, Godot, GameMaker Studio
  * 3D or 2D
  * drag-and-drop GUI
  * programming not necessarily involved
    * you won't be programming the main loop, but attaching your scripts on top of existing structures
  * suited for games big and small
  * jack of all trades, master of none

### Type 2: Framework

  * Love2D, Monogame, Pygame
  * Especially suited for 2D
  * no engine application window: almost everything happens in a text editor
  * basically an API full of helper functions
    * "draw sprite on coordinates x,y"
  * suited for people who...
    * want to have a tighter control on what's happening under the hood
    * want to build their own structures
    * think all-purpose engines tend to get in their way 

### Type 3: Specialized Engine

  * Renpy, RPGMaker, Adventure Game Studio, Twine...
  * A tool for making a specific kind of game
  * can involve code or its own scripting/description language
  * very fast for the exact thing it does
  * easier to comprehend fully due to limited scope
